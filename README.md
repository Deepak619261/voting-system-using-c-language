# Voting System in C++ üó≥Ô∏è

## Project Overview
This is a secure console-based Voting System implemented in C++. The system allows users to register as candidates or voters, securely log in to cast their vote, and view real-time election results. The project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage election processes effectively.

## Features
- **Candidate Registration**: Candidates can register with their name, ID, and password.
- **Voter Registration**: Voters can register by providing their name, ID, and password.
- **Secure Voting**: Voters can log in securely using their ID and password to cast their vote.
- **Vote Tracking**: The system tracks whether a voter has already voted to prevent multiple votes.
- **Result Display**: View the current voting results in real-time.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voting-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd voting-system
    ```
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ voting_system.cpp -o voting_system
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./voting_system
    ```

## Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with the following options:

1. **Register Candidate**: Enter candidate details to register.
2. **Register Voter**: Enter voter details to register.
3. **Login and Vote**: Voters can log in and cast their vote.
4. **Show Results**: Display the current vote tally.
5. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The project is built entirely in C++ using standard libraries such as `iostream`, `vector`, `map`, and `string`.
- **OOP Principles**: The project extensively uses Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
